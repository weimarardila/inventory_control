# Inventory Control

## EOQ multi-item with Storage Limitations

The model manages n (>1) items, where the items are competing for limited storage capacity.


## Solution method
Step 1. Compute the unconstrained values of the order quantities as:

Step 2. Check if the unconstrained values optimal values satisfy the storage constraint. Otherwise, go to the next step.

Step 3. Use the Lagrange multipliers method to determine the constrained optimal values of the order quantities.
